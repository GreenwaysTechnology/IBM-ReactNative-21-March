                                            React Native
..............................................................................................

What is React Native?

1.React Native is lib for building native mobile apps 
2.React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class  JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Mobile App development:

 Mobile apps are built using mobile platforms and os.

Mobile platforms:
1.Android
2.Ios

Mobile devices are acting front end devices, user interfaces communicates back end services.

Dev:
 1.user interface developer/front end developer
 2.back end developer
 3.full stack developer.

Front end developer who dev apps for  front devices.

Devices:
 1.computers - desktop
 2.Hand held devices- Mobiles,Tabs..
 3.TV,Game consoles
 4.IOT devices- It could be any - watches,car,industrial apps,

Dev generally build apps for desktops:
  Standalone desktop apps
  Browser based apps- javascript,html,css - react,angular,vue.....

Mobile /Tab apps:
 Dev builds apps for android platform using java , kotlin pl.
 in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C.

Types of mobile Apps:
.....................

1.Native Mobile
2.Web apps
3.Hybrid apps

1.Native Mobile
   Mobiles built by using native platform languages- java / Swift.
2.Web apps
   Apps built for browsers -Mobile browsers
3.Hybrid  apps
   built apps using javascript but it wont run inside browser, runs inside mobile using
  container(WebView).


Hybrid apps:

 Application built using javascript,css,html,looks like native apps.

Why Hybrid Apps?

-incase native apps, we need to maintain two code base for both platform.

Why not to build one single portable app for all platforms?

 That is birth of hybrid apps.

Hybrids apps can be built using existing web tech- js,css,html.
Js is simple dom language, how to acess platform services such as contacts,networks,storage..
- a lib was created -cordova , based on cordova adobe started building a framework on top of the cordova , called phoneGap.

How to build mobile native apps in portable way using same javascript technology without html
and css?

That is birth of React Native.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

React Native Architecture :
...........................

React native applications are written using react(js) core principles
 -Component
 -Props
 -State
 -Event Handling

Every react native apps are simple javascript code.

In React Native, there is no webview concept. React native never run inside browser.

Types of React Native code:

React Native code consist of Two things:
.......................................

1.UI MARK UP Code
   -  incase of react , html is mark up

UI Mark Up code for React native:

React native does not use html language to build ui elements.
React Native provides a high level ui components already written, so we can use those
components only.Why?
 We are building portable application either for android or ios.
So we need generic concept for both  platforms. 
For that React native provides a generic components for both platforms.

Compilation:
What is it? What is happening during compilation?

Source code is converted into another source code - Compilation.
Another code is platform specific code. android code or ios code.
if i wirte ui components, ui components will be converted to platform spefic components.
javascript code will be emitted as it is-app code.



2.Application logic code
   - js code - apis,state,props......


1.Source Code
    written in react - UI Code and app logic

2.Compiled code
    code converted into platform specific code.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How react native apps are executed?  Execution Model:
.....................................................

All views are executed by platform runtimes eg: android by art.
All javascript is executed by JavaScriptCore Js engine.

How to build react native apps?


React native apps can be built using two work flows.


1.Native Work flow

 If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI.
 It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.

2.Expo Work Flow.
  If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Native work flow:
 
if you want to build professional mobile app you need lot of infrastructure.
 UI Components
    -Views,Text,Labels,ListViews,ScrollView,TabView...........

React native core team provides all core components necessary to build mobile apps.

What if i want more components which is not supported by react core team.

YOu need to look at community or companies who provides professional mobile apps.

Expo Work flow:
...............
What is expo?

 Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Setup :

Expo work flow Setup
....................

1.install expo-cli

npm install -g expo-cli

2.Create project

expo init AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start

Expo apps can be created in two ways


Managed Work flow:

  With the managed workflow you only write JavaScript / TypeScript and Expo tools and services take care of everything else for you.

  The managed workflow is kind of like Rails and Create React App, but for React Native.

Apps are built with the managed workflow using the expo-cli, the Expo Go app on your mobile device, and our various services: push notifications, the build service, and over-the-air (OTA) updates. 

Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps for you as we can, which is why we call it the managed workflow.

 A developer using the managed workflow doesn't use Xcode or Android Studio, they just write JavaScript code and manage configuration for things like the app icon and splash screen through app.json.

 The Expo SDK exposes an increasingly comprehensive set of APIs that give you the power to access device capabilities like the camera, biometric authentication, file system, haptics, and so on.

Bare Work flow:

  In the bare workflow you have full control over every aspect of the native project, and Expo tools and services are a little more limited.

In the bare workflow the developer has complete control, along with the complexity that comes with that. You can use most APIs in the Expo SDK, but the build service and easy Configuration with app.json / app.config.js are not yet supported.

Running your React Native application in case of expo work flow:
.................................................................

1.You can run and test app inside browser itself- this is not recommended for complex apps.

2.You can run inside your device directly.
  Expo offers called expo client.
3.You can use emulators -Andorid virtual devices or emulators.

Metro Bundler:
-Online compiler, compiles code into react native
